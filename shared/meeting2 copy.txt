## Agenda
1. Review of Proposed CI/CD Architecture
2. Tool Evaluation and Selection
3. Integration with Existing Systems
4. Security & Compliance Considerations
5. Open Discussion

## Discussion Points
- **Architecture Overview:**  
  - Proposed layered approach: Source Control -> Build Server -> Test Automation -> Deployment.
  - Emphasis on containerization and microservices architecture to support scalability.
- **Tool Evaluation:**  
  - **CI Tools:**  
    - Jenkins: Flexible, wide plugin ecosystem.
    - GitLab CI: Seamless integration with version control.
  - **Containerization & Orchestration:**  
    - Docker for containerization.
    - Kubernetes for deployment and scaling.
  - **Testing & Monitoring:**  
    - Integration of Selenium for automated UI tests.
    - Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and alerts.
- **Integration with Existing Systems:**  
  - Plan to integrate with current version control systems (GitHub).
  - Ensure compatibility with legacy systems where needed.
- **Security & Compliance:**  
  - Fiona Chan raised concerns about vulnerabilities in container images.
  - Discussion on incorporating security scanning tools (e.g., Clair, Trivy) into the CI pipeline.
- **Open Discussion:**  
  - Emphasis on flexibility to swap tools if needed.
  - Need for a sandbox environment for testing the new pipeline.

## Action Items
- **Bob Martinez:** Create a proof-of-concept (POC) pipeline using Jenkins and Docker by 2025-02-24.
- **Clara Nguyen & David Lee:** Collaborate on designing automated test suites that integrate into the pipeline.
- **Fiona Chan:** Draft a security review document outlining the key requirements for the CI/CD process.

## Next Meeting
- **Date:** 2025-02-24  
- **Focus:** Review POC results and finalize tool selection.
